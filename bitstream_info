Every note will be a 16th note that can be tied to the past note for different lengths
To add triplet support, 3 16th notes starting on a down beat with a 16th note rest
following it will be considered 3 triplets.
Size of chromosome will be 1 + (16 * # of bars) bytes long

First byte in the chromosome:
bits 0-3: tempo
bits 4-6: type of instrument
bit    7: Melody always 1, Accompaniment always 0

All following bytes:
bits 0-5: Note
bits 6-7: Articulation/Rest/Tie
	  00 - rest
	  01 - tie
	  10 - normal
	  11 - hard
